After a fair bit of thought \(and consultation with the universe\) you decide to choose the ```rightmost door```.  Something was telling you that choosing the middle door was a bad idea, but the rightmost one seems pretty good!

Before you open the door, a voice appears in your head.

>Halt! Before you enter that door, know this: behind the middle door is certain death, so you cannot choose it. Do you keep your choice? Or do you choose the leftmost door instead?
