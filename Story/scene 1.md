This is the BEGINNING SCENE. This is the same in every timeline and shouldn't be changed.

Before you is THREE DOORS. They are:

1. The leftmost door

2. The rightmost door

3. The middle door

Behind 2 doors is certain death, and behind the third door is freedom. Luckily, you are able to predict the future with 33% accuracy, which is 40% if you round up, which is better than just blind guessing! So you totally got this.
