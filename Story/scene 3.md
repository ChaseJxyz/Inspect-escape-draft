After further thought \(and universal consultation\), you come to the conclusion that this seems really familiar, and that there's some trick to this riddle, but unfortunately you smoked some of California's finest when playing the game that went over this, so you don't actually know what to do. You're also in too much of a blind panic to sit down and think this one out \(and math was never one of your strong suits, anyhow\).

You know what? This all seems like a trap. Why would the mysterious voice 'help' you by telling you which of the doors is death? You decide to channel your inner wildcard and confidently open the ```middlest door```.

Surprsingly, that is the correct choice! Something in the back of your head tells you that this makes no logical sense, that the voice had some idea of what it was doing...but hey, this works? And you've escaped, so you're not going to question it further.

GOOD END \(from the left\)
