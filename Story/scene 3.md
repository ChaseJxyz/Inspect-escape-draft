After further thought \(and universal consultation\), you come to the conclusion that this seems really familiar, and that there's some trick to this riddle, but unfortunately you smoked some of California's finest when playing the game that went over this, so you don't actually know what to do. You're also in too much of a blind panic to sit down and think this one out \(and math was never one of your strong suits, anyhow\).

You know what? YOLO, you stick with your decision to choose the ```leftmost door```. You are absolutely certain it is the correct decision.

Alas, it is not, and you are certainly dead.

THE END \(of the leftmost timeline\).
