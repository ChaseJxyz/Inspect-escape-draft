# Inspect-escape-draft
The draft version of &lt;Inspect> &amp;

## Synopsis

Amira escapes from the Western Stags. There are multiple timelines with only one "successul" one. There is no code editing/interaction from the reader, they only jump to different branches/version of the repo.

### This thing

This isn't actually Amira, and this is totally not the character that has a history dying in non-cannon demos.

There's no pretty way to go from one scene to another, you'll have to go back to the /Story folder to pick the next scene \(they're numerical order\). There's another scene if the scene doesn't end with an END.

To change the timeline \(i.e. change the door you pick\) pick a branch from the dropdown. You can also see it graphically under insights \> network. 

Also this applies to all the timelines/branches. I just forgot to write this at the start and since this is just a proof of concept I'm not gonna copy/paste it in all the timelines.


#### Changelog
